        <h2>October 19, 2024: The Lord is My Refuge and Strength</h2>
        <p>During times of chaos, confusion, and calamity we all need a Savior who provides a place of refuge, strength, and safety. During the times I’ve felt afraid
and confused, I’ve had to lean into the Lord as my Refuge and Strength. 
        </p>The prayer below is a prayer I wrote when I needed to remind myself of Whom I can call on in times of trouble. Use it to remind yourself of who God is for you in
times of trouble. Then use the scriptures to meditate on and declare the promises of God over your life.</p>
        <p>Prayer
I love You Lord. Thank You for hearing my cry. I trust Your Word that says that they that
wait upon You will constantly be refreshed and renewed. I will wait on You Lord.</p>
        </p>Scripture Verses: "Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage,And He shall strengthen your heart;Wait, I say, on
the Lord!" Psalm 27:14
"I love the Lord, because He has heard My voice and my supplications." Psalm 116:1
"But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings
like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." Isaiah 40:31
