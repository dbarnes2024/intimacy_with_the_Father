        <h2>Today's Devotional: Trusting God's Timing</h2>
        <p>
            Trusting God’s timing can be one of the hardest things we do in our walk of faith. But the Bible reminds us in Ecclesiastes 3:11 that "He has made everything beautiful in its time." Patience is a sign of faith. When we surrender our timeline to God, we allow His perfect will to be done in our lives. Spend time today asking Him to align your heart with His timing, and trust that He is working all things for your good.

        <p>
            Take a moment to meditate on the promises God has made throughout Scripture. From His covenant with Abraham to the promise of a Savior, every word has been fulfilled. When you feel uncertain or lost, remember that God’s promises are unshakable and eternal. Stand firm in your faith today!
